You will get an email/Whatsapp/SMS from Paytm Insider notifying you about ticket sales being open. We will also make an announcement about the same on our social media handles so make sure you follow us and keep your eyes peeled!

<emp>Is the concert open to people of all ages?</emp>

Yes! We wouldn’t want anyone missing out on this amazing experience. A few things to keep in mind, though: Children up to the age of 3 years can enter for free but no seating may be provided for them. Children above that age will require a ticket. Due to the event involving a live band performance, all parents/guardians are requested to bring their kids at their own discretion. If you are under the age of 16, you will need to be accompanied by an adult guardian.
